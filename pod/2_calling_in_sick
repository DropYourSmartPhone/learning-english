A: Hi Julie, how are you?
B: Actually I’m feeling quite ill today.
A: Oh, I’m sorry to hear that. What’s wrong?
B: I think I’m coming down with the flu. 
I have a headache, a sore throat, a runny nose and I’m feeling slightly feverish.
A: I see..... so you’re calling in sick?
B: Yes. I was hoping to take the day off to recover.
