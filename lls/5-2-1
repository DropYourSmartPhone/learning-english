# The Psychology of love 1
One of the most important human emotions is love.
However, there are many different kinds of love.
Romantic love is certainly one of the most interesting kinds of love.
It can be beautiful, wonderful, and heartbreaking, sometimes all at the same time.

Romantic love can make our lives full and meaningful, but it can also be an escape from loneliness and suffering.
If romantic love has a purpose, neither psychology nor biology has discovered it.
However, throughout history, philosophers have offered opinions about it.

The Greek philosopher, Plato, said love makes us complete.
He relates a comic story in which humans originally had 4 arms, 4 legs and 2 faces.
Then, when they angered the Gods, they were cut in half.
Since then every person has been searching for their soulmate, the other half of his or her self.

Another philosopher believed that love is an illusion.
In his view, people fall in love because they believe the other person can make them happy.
But in fact, this is just an illusion designed to make us have children.
Once we have children, we are right back to where we were, still searching for happiness.
For nature this is a success, because we have children to maintain our species.
But it leaves us still searching for something more.
If something is an illusion，it isn't what it seems to be.

In Buddhism, romantic love is seen as an attempt to satisfy our desires.
These desires are a defect, something we need to overcome.
The way to free ourselves from suffering is to remove desires.
Once free of desires we can reach a state of peace and wisdom.
This state of being is called nirvana.
Other kinds of love include love between a parent and child.

# The Psychology of love 2
In one of China's greatest classical novels, Dream of the Red Chamber, love is presented as a state of foolishness.
A young man falls in love with a beautiful woman who tricks and makes a fool of him.
This results in conflicting emotions of love and hate which tear him apart.
To cure him, a priest gives him a magic mirror.
The priest tells him to look into the reverse side of the mirror, but never to look in the front side.

When the young man looks into the mirror, he doesn't like what he sees, so he looks into the forbidden side, the front side.
There he sees the lovely image of his love, who invites him into the mirror to be with her.
He does this several times until he is finally dragged away in chains.
He dies while looking into the mirror.

Perhaps the point of the story is that all such attachments should be avoided.
（He enters the mirror to be with his love and satisfy his desires.）
（Once free of desires we can reach a state of peace and wisdom.）

A famous French writer, Simone de Beauvoir has another point of view.
For her, love is the desire to integrate with another, like in a great friendship.
However, it is important that lovers not become too dependent on the other person.
Becoming dependent on another person can lead to boredom or power games.
Lovers should support each other in discovering themselves and developing their potentials.
In this way, romantic love can enrich the world.

Falling in love can be exciting and frightening.
Maybe we lose ourselves and maybe we find ourselves.
Will you dare to find out?

# The teenage years
What's so funny?
What are you writing about?
I'm writing about something I saw earlier this morning.
Really? Do you keep a journal?
Yes, I do.
Every weekend I write about things that happened during the week.
How long have you been doing it?
I've been doing it fairly regularly since high school.
Are you going to turn it into a book?
I don't know.
Maybe I will someday but for now it's just for me.

So what was so interesting about what you saw this morning.
I was in the same coffee shop I usually go to and a group of teenagers came in.
I couldn't help watching them and trying to hear some of their conversation.
That must have been interesting.
Yes, it was.
The more I watched them the more I realized how glad I am that I don't have to go through that stage of life again.
So it brought back some memorizes?
Yes, it did.
It was so clear how uncomfortable some of them were, yet they were pretending to have a good time.
At least, that's how it seemed to me.
Why do you think they were pretending?
It was just the way they smiled and laughed.
It seemed unnatural and overdone, as if they were bad actors.
A couple of the boys were really awkward around the girls, and two of the girls were wearing too much makeup.
I had to stop myself laughing.
Yes, I can imagine it.

I can remember wanting to be popular when I was in high school.
Now that you mention it, it wasn't a great time, though I had some fun too.
I guess it wasn't so bad at the time, except when I was preparing for my university entrance examinations.
Yes, that was awful.
My parents put tons of pressure on me, so I thought I was going to go crazy.
What about girls?
Did you have any girlfriends?
There was one girl I had a crush on, but I thought she was interested in somebody else.
I didn't find out until much later that she was interested in me too.
It was a lost opportunity, one of many.

Really? you should become a writer or make a movie.
You have a great imagination.
To be honest, it's much easier to imagine things than actually do things.
You can say that again.
（A group of teenagers came into the coffee shop where he was sitting.）
