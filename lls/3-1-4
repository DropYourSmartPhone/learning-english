# 1-Christina's Future plan I
Christina sells women's clothing in a department store.
She usually works 6 days a week, but this week she's going to take 3 days off.
She’s taking time off so that she can visit her parents.
Her parents live in the mountains, about three hours away by train.
They are looking forward to seeing her.
They haven’t seen her for almost a year.
Christina is their only child.

Christina isn’t going on the trip by herself.
Her boyfriend is going with her.
She is going to introduce him to her parents.
She and her boyfriend want to get married.
If everything goes well, they plan to get married in 6 months.
After they get married, Christina plans to quit her job. 
She wants to spend more time designing clothes.
She wants to set up her own business.
This will take time.
Her boyfriend thinks it’s a good idea.
He's also thinking about starting his own business.

They don’t plan to have children right away.
In fact, they may decide not to have children.
They don’t know yet.
It’s going to be a big decision.

# 2-Christina's Future Plan II
Christina’s parents want her to marry and have children.
They are looking forward to having grandchildren.
They don’t want her to start her own business. 
They think it’s more important to have children.
In fact, they would like her to live closer to them.
They want to be close to their grandchildren.

So Christina doesn’t plan to tell her parents everything.
For now, she just wants them to meet her boyfriend.
She wants them to be happy that she is going to get married. 
She wants them to like him and see her happiness.
She wants her parents to accept her way of life. 

Life isn’t the same now as it used to be.
