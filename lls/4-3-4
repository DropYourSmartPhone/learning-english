# 1- Dream Jobs
What kind of careers are the best, and what are the qualifications?

One of the most popular careers for kids is to become an *astronaut.
Many kids *dream of going into space when they grow up.
They dream of working *on a space station or exploring deep space.

To become an astronaut it's important to have the right background.
Many astronauts have a background *in engineering, physics or medicine.
sometimes they have a military background, such as flying military aircraft.
As for pay, astronauts can earn a good salary, but not great.

Another popular career is to become a musician or actor.
Many kids dream of becoming famous singers or movie stars.
However, most musicians and actors don't *become famous.
*They are usually paid by the hour or by the performance.
Only a very few earn lots of money.
So the best advice is not to become a musician or actor unless that's your real passion.

Becoming a professional athlete is another *dream job for many.
*It's nice to imagine playing a favorite sport and getting paid for it.
However, becoming a professional athlete takes a lot of work and practice.
Great athletes practice for hours a day with teammates and coaches.
They also work regularly with *trainers to keep their bodies strong.
The level of pay for athletes depends on the success and level of their performance.
Athletes often have short careers because of the physical requirements of their sport.
When they are no longer able to compete at a high level, some athletes become coaches.

Firefighters and police officers are important jobs that help and protect people.
These careers require applicants to complete training programs and pass written and physical tests.
These jobs can be exciting and dangerous, so they require courage and sometimes sacrifice.

# 2- Jobs and Wages
When considering salary and benefits, some of the lowest paying jobs are in the hospitality and beauty industries.
For example, *food service workers and hair stylists generally have low salaries.
These kinds of jobs don't require much education or training.

But again, if you enjoy what you are doing, *that may be good enough.
For example, you may really enjoy talking with your customers.
Spending your life doing something you dislike can be very unsatisfying, even if the salary is high.

Some of the highest paid professions include doctors, lawyers and scientists.
However, these professions require high levels of education and training.
*The path to becoming a doctor, for example, is a long one.
Doctors require a university degree, several years in medical school and several more years of experience.
Only then are they certified as a medical doctor, or MD.

So it doesn't make sense to consider these professions unless you are willing to work hard for many years.
And of course, you should really care about doing the work well.

# 3- Types of Wars
Civil wars are *fought between citizens of the same country, and are fought within the country.
If citizens of a country *disagree about a policy or leader, they may fight a civil war.

A world war is fought when countries form alliances, and these alliances fight each other.
A world war involves many or most of the world's most powerful countries.
There were 2 world wars in the 20th century.

Terrorism involves groups of individuals rather than countries.
Terrorists may come from different countries, and they may share the same *beliefs.
*Terrorists often use car bombings and suicide attacks on innocent people.
A terrorist attack can happen at any time and any place.

An invasion occurs when one country attacks another.
It sends its army into the other country, and *attempts to take control.
One of the most famous invasions was when France invaded Russia in 1812.

A defensive war occurs when a country is attacked and needs to defend itself.
Most countries have a military, so that it can defend itself if it's attacked.
When France invaded Russia in 1812 the Russian army fought a defensive war and defeated the French army.

If a country wants to expand its borders, it may attack its neighboring countries.
Over 60 million people were killed in world war II.
Throughout history, there have been many invasions.
Sometimes two leaders will fight for power within a country and start a civil war.
