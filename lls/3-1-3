He can afford an expensive car.

# 2-Buying a New Car II
Paul wants to help reduce pollution and smog.
He would like to buy a clean car, something good for the environment. 
He's thinking about buying a Tesla.
The Tesla is an all electric car.
It uses batteries instead of gasoline.
There is no ex haust, so it doesn’t pollute the air.

However, the car can’t go very far without recharging the battery.
To charge the battery, you can plug it into an electrical outlet.
Recharging the battery takes time.
One of Paul’s friends has one and is quite happy with it.
He says it’s reliable and well-engineered.
There are also several charging stations near Paul’s office.
So he isn’t worried about that.
The cost for charging the battery is low.
It’s less expensive than buying gasoline.
His wife, Kathy, also likes the idea of buying an electric car. 
She likes the idea of driving a clean car.
So it makes sense.

In the future, there may be driverless cars.
These maybe very safe, but Paul doesn’t like them.
He enjoys driving.
He likes to be in control of his car.

Do you take selfies?

Sometimes, but my girlfriend takes a lot of selfies. Then she shares them with her friends online. 
I don't understand why people like to take so many pictures of themselves.
That's because you are old-fashioned.
