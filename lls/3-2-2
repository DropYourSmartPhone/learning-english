# Paul's Trip Plan 1
In six weeks, Paul is going on a trip.
He is going to Japan and China. 
There are a couple of reasons for the trip. 
One reason is for business. 
He’s thinking about starting restaurants in both countries. 
The other reason is for pleasure. 
He enjoys traveling, and he’d like to visit some friends. 

Yesterday he went online and made airline reservations. 
There were plenty of seats on the plane, so it was easy.
He also got a good discount. 
Unfortunately, he needs a new passport. 
His old passport is expiring next week. 
This is something he didn’t expect. 
Getting a new passport will take at least a week. 
He needs to apply for one right away.

Paul also needs a visa to enter China. 
The last time he went to china was 3 years ago. 
Getting a visa may also take a week or even two. 
So he doesn’t have much time. 
He needs to hurry. 
He can’t get the visa until he gets his new passport. 
He'll have to go to the Chinese consulate Toronto. 
Hopefully there won’t be any delays.

# Paul's Trip Plan 2
Paul has several friends in each country. 
One of his best friends lives near Mount Fuji. 
His friend lives near a beautiful lake about 3 hours from Tokyo. 
His friend is a great cook and owns a little restaurant. 
The restaurant is located on a hill above the lake.
It has a wonderful view, and the food is wonderful. 
Paul is looking forward to eating there. 
Then he will spend the night at his friend’s house. 
One way to get to his friend’s house is to go by train. 
If he takes a train, his friend will meet him at the train station. 
There's a train station about half an hour from his friend’s house. 
On the other hand, he may decide to go by car. 
He can rent a car for a few days and see more of the country.
He can use a GPS to help him with directions. 
He doesn’t speak Japanese, so the directions need to be in English.

In China, Paul has a good friend who lives in Beijing. 
They studied at the same university in Canada more than 15 years ago. 
His Chinese friend wants to help Paul with his business.
His friends has lots of business experience. 
His friend can help Paul learn about doing business in China. 
Paul knows there is a lot to learn. 
He will certainly need his friend’s help. 
While in Beijing, they plan to visit several Italian restaurants. 
They may meet with some of the owners too, but it isn’t certain yet. 
Most of the owners are Chinese. 
One or two of them may want to do business with Paul.

If he has time, he may go to the Great Wall of China. 
It’s a few hours outside of Beijing by car.

Altogether, the trip may take 3 or more weeks. 
Paul still isn’t sure how long he will stay in each country. 
He may spend a week in Japan and two weeks in China. 
He may decide to stay longer. 
Everything depends on his friends. 
He expects to get more information from them in the next day or two.

# Sports
In basketball, players score points by shooting a basketball through a hoop.
Each side has 5 players and the game is played on a basketball court.

Football is probably the world's most popular sport.
Each team tries to score a goal by kicking the ball into a net.

Baseball is a team sport where each side has 9 players.
Baseball players use a bat to try to hit the ball and get on base.

Golf is an individual sport where players try to hit the ball into a hole in the ground.
The game is played on a golf course with 18 holes.

In boxing the two boxers stand in a boxing ring and hit each other.
Sometimes a boxer, like this one, knocks the other one out.

# Injuries
When people fall down, they can break a bone.
A broken bone can be very painful.

If someone is cut, they will bleed.
A knife or sharp object can cut someone and cause bleeding.

Poisons are very dangerous and can cause death.
Some snakes and spiders are poisonous, so be careful.

A heart attack can happen very suddenly.
If someone has a heart attack, call for an ambulance right away.

If you catch on fire, fall to the ground and roll.
Getting too close to a fire can be very dangerous.

# A nightmare
Whats the matter?
You look really tired today.
I am tired. I didn’t sleep well last night.
Bad dream.
Yes, exactly. I had a terrible dream, a really nightmare. 
So it woke you up.
Yes, it woke me up. I was really scared.
I’ve had those kinds of dreams too.
It was so scary that I was afraid to go back to sleep.
Was something chasing you?
No, nothing was chasing me, but I wasfalling. I was falling faster and faster, and it wasdark.
I couldn’t see or hear anything.
Can you remember anything else?
Yes, I remember now.
In my dream I was screaming, but there was no sound. I thought I was going to die at any second.
Wow. That is scary. So what did you do when you woke up?
I didn’t want to go back to sleep, so I checked the news online. Then I played the game.
You didn’t go back to sleep?
Actually I got too tired playing the gamethat I fell asleep.
Well, at least you got some sleep. Some sleep is better than no sleep.
I guess so.
But I’m still tired.
I hope I can get through the day.
Have a good lunch and then work out in theafternoon.
Thanks, I’m already feeling a bit better.
Hey, look! the boss is coming.
Look like you’re working hard.

# Toilet Trouble
Hey what’s that awful smell?
The toilet is broken in the men’s bathroom.
Wow, I can’t work when it smells this bad. I need some fresh air.
Ok let’s take a break and go out for a walk. Get your computer and we can work at the coffe shop.
Good idea, when do you think it will be clean up.
A plumber is coming and he should be here soon.
By the time we get back the smell should be gone.
That’s one job that I wouldn’t want. I hate to be around bad smells. What about you?
Me too, I wouldn’t want to be a plumber. There are lots of jobs that I won’t want.
We can talk about that later.
Get your computer and let’s get out of here.

A plumber is coming to clean things up and fix the toilet.
Stop working for a while.
