# Emma's Best - 1
Emma's Best is a small but growing health food company.
It was started in 1995 by a married couple who were tired of working for large companies.
The two founders were Ed and Emma Smith, both health-conscious vegetarians.

Despite the risks, Ed and Emma wanted to start their own business.
They knew it would be hard work, but they were determined to try.
Their plan was to create a business that provided healthy food to busy people.
They wanted it（their new company） to be something they could be proud of.

When they started the company, organic food was becoming more popular.
People were becoming more food conscious and worried about food safety.
In fact, people were willing to pay higher prices for food that was free of harmful chemicals.
In addition, an increasing number of people had little time to go shopping and cook at home.
They wanted meals that were healthy but easy to prepare.

There were very few frozen meals available at the time, and none of them were vegetarian or organic.
There was a gap in the market.

Ed and Emma immediately saw the opportunity and launched their first product.
It was a frozen pasta meal with a mix of vegetables and a delicious cream sauce.
The market response was enthusiastic and profitable beyond their expectations.
Their product was an instant success.

To their surprise it was soon being eaten by millions of people, not only vegetarians or those interested in organic foods.
It was being bought because it was easy to prepare and it tasted good.
And of course it was healthy.
Other products followed in rapid succession.

As a result, at the end of 5 years, the company was producing over 100 frozen meals.
Since then they have increased the number of meals to over 150, including pizzas, sandwiches and snacks.
Their foods are carried by natural food stores and supermarkets throughout North America.
（People were willing to pay more for food that was free of harmful chemicals.）
