# Point of View I
This man is holding a piece of fruit in his hand.
The piece of fruit is either an orange or an apple.
We can’t see which it is because we can’t see inside the box.
The probability that it is an orange is equal to the probability that it is an apple.
It may be an apple, and it may be an orange.
It’s got to be one or the other.
It can’t be anything else.

Now let’s look at it from the man’s point of view.
From his point of view, the probabilities are different.
From his point of view, the probability that he has an orange is 100% or 0%.
That’s because he knows what he has.
For him there is no uncertainty. 
If he has an orange, the probability is 100%.
If he doesn’t have an orange, the probability is 0%.
He either has it or he doesn’t.

From his point of view, the probability that he has an orange is 100% or 0%.
So the probability depends on your point of view.

# Point of View II
People see things from different points of view.
This often leads to arguments between people.
Here are some examples.
From this man’s point of view, he is relaxing.
He needs to relax because he has been working too hard.
He hasn’t been getting enough sleep.
If his wife asks him to get up and help her, he probably won't be happy.
If his wife shouts at him and tells him to get up and do something he may shout back and refuse to help her.

His wife sees things differently.
She isn’t aware of how hard he has been working.
From her point of view, he is doing nothing.
However, she knows what needs to be done around the house.
It isn’t fair that she has to work while he does nothing.
If he refuses to get up and help her she will be angry at him.

When people see things from different points of view, they often come to different conclusions.
These differences can cause real communication problems.
